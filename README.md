# Ruby on Rails sample microblogging application

This is a sample application developed with Ruby on Rails, based on the Ruby on Rails tutorial
by Michael Hartl. Specifically, this application is a microblogging app that allows you to 
sign up as a new user, and, once you are signed in, you may perform a variety of tasks, such as:

1. Compose a micropost (up to 140 characters long, of course)
2. View your microposts and micropost feed
3. Follow other users
4. See who is following you
5. View the directory of users
6. Edit your profile
7. Get help if you are stuck
8. Sign out and go back to the main page

This application was built following the principles of test-driven development (TDD), and thus, I have used Capybara (acceptance test framework for Web apps) as well as RSpec (unit-testing framework) extensively. 

Additionally, to spruce up the design, I used Bootstrap, a framework from Twitter, along with some custom CSS.
